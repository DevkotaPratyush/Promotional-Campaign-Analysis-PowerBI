# Promotional-Campaign-Analysis-PowerBI
Use Case-
This analysis was performed on a company who has multiple stores accross different cities in india and ran a promotional campaign on two saperate occasions where they gave 5 different offers to customers. Now, the company wants to visualise and quantify the impact of their promotional offers on product performance.

Objective-

📈 Incremental Performance- I evaluated the incremental revenue and unit sales generated during these campaigns. Understanding the bottom-line impact is crucial for refining sales strategies.

📊 Market Penetration: Analyzing the average growth of stores gave a comprehensive view of how each location contributed to the overall success of the campaigns.

💡 Impact Assessment: Analzing the overall effectiveness of the campaigns comparing before and after promotion sales will acurately evaluate the scale of positive or negative impact these offers had among the customers.

🏙️ Segment-specific Analysis: By drilling down into specific demographics, product categories, and even individual products, we gained insights into which areas were most responsive to our promotions. This granular analysis helps us tailor our strategies for maximum impact.

👥 Key Influencer Analysis: One of the most illuminating aspects of this analysis was the key influencer study. By looking into what factors influenced revenue fluctuations, we gained a deeper understanding of the dynamics at play during promotional periods.

💰 Strategic Pricing Optimization: Identifying which high base price items saw the maximum increase in sales allowed us to focus our efforts on promoting products with the highest potential for growth and margin.

🔍 Advanced Filters: With filters enabled by campaign, promotion, city, and product category, we were able to slice and dice the data to extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions.


Finally, I acknowledge that there are some shortcomings in the dashboard- like negative values with a () or some inconsistent fonts. In conclusion, while I'm dedicated to data-driven decision-making, I'm still learning and despite the hiccups this experience has been invaluable. I had given myself a set deadline of some hours to finish this and hey! an imperfectly finished job is always better than a perfectly done half of the job.
